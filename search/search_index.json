This plugin is still in alpha status. Here is how it looks with the mkdocs-material theme for now: Features \u00b6 Works great with Material theme: mkdocstrings was designed to work best with the great Material theme . Support for type annotations: mkdocstrings uses your type annotations to display parameters types or return types. Recursive documentation of Python objects: just write the module dotted-path, and you get the full module docs. No need to ask for each class, function, etc. Support for documented attribute: attributes (variables) followed by a docstring (triple-quoted string) will be recognized by mkdocstrings , in modules, classes and even in __init__ methods. Support for objects properties: mkdocstrings will know if a method is a staticmethod , a classmethod or else, it will also know if a property is read-only or writable, and more! These properties will be displayed next to the object signature. Every object has a TOC entry and a unique permalink: the navigation is greatly improved! Click the anchor next to the object signature to get its permalink, which is its Python dotted-path. Auto-reference other objects: mkdocstrings makes it possible to reference other Python objects from your markdown files, and even from your docstrings, with the classic Markdown syntax: [this object][package.module.object] or directly with [package.module.object][] . Google-style sections support in docstrings: mkdocstrings understands Arguments: , Raises: and Returns: sections. It will even keep the section order in the generated docs. Support for source code display: mkdocstrings can add a collapsible div containing the source code of the Python object, directly below its signature, with the right line numbers. Admonition support in docstrings: blocks like Note: or Warning: will be transformed to their admonition equivalent. We do not support nested admonitions in docstrings! Sane defaults: you should be able to just drop the plugin in your configuration and enjoy your auto-generated docs. Configurable: (soon) mkdocstrings is configurable globally, and per autodoc instruction. To get an example of what is possible, check mkdocstrings ' own documentation , generated with itself. Requirements \u00b6 mkdocstrings requires Python 3.6 or above. To install Python 3.6, I recommend using pyenv . # install pyenv git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv # setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar) export PATH = \" ${ HOME } /.pyenv/bin: ${ PATH } \" export PYENV_ROOT = \" ${ HOME } /.pyenv\" eval \" $( pyenv init - ) \" # install Python 3.6 pyenv install 3 .6.8 # make it available globally pyenv global system 3 .6.8 Installation \u00b6 With pip : python3.6 -m pip install mkdocstrings Usage \u00b6 # mkdocs.yml # designed to work best with material theme theme : name : \"material\" # these extensions are required for best results markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite - attr_list - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.inlinehilite - toc : permalink : true plugins : - search - mkdocstrings In one of your markdown files: # Reference ::: my_library.my_module.my_class You can reference objects from other modules in your docstrings: def some_function (): \"\"\" This is my function.

They will all be concatenated in one line, so do not try to use complex markup here. Important: Note how we omitted the type hints next to the parameters names. Usually you would write something like `param1 (int): ...`, but `mkdocstrings` gets the type information from the signature, so it's not needed here. Exceptions are written the same.

Here is how to use it: instantiate a Documenter instance with user configuration (currently only global filters). get an instance of a subclass of Object ( Module , Class , Method , Function , or Attribute ) with the documenter's get_object_documentation method. The method takes the dotted-path to an object as argument. get Markdown contents by calling the documented object's [ render ][mkdocstrings.documenter.Object.render] method with more configuration options (should be refactored). Here is how we proceed: The documentation for an object is obtained recursively, by walking through its children objects (module classes, module functions, class methods, class attributes, class nested classes, etc.). Each one of the object is instantiated using its correct category (Module, Class, Method, or Function). The children of an object are organized into these same categories: modules , classes , methods , and functions . The attributes documentation is obtained by parsing the code with the ast module. We simply search for \"assignment\" or \"annotated assignment\" nodes followed by \"docstring\" nodes (expressions or strings). Attribute children are stored in an object's attributes attribute by dispatching them onto the object thanks to their dotted-paths. Each docstring is parsed to build a list of \"docstring sections\". Such a section can be a markdown block of lines, a block of parameters, a block of exceptions, an admonition, or the information about the return value. Exceptions and the return value are instances of [ AnnotatedObject ][mkdocstrings.documenter.AnnotatedObject], while parameters are instances of the [ Parameter ][mkdocstrings.documenter.Parameter] class, which is a subclass of AnnotatedObject . To build these sections, we search for blocks matching the Google style for docstrings. For example: Note: This is a note. ...will be parsed as a \"note\" admonition, while: Arguments: param1: Description of param1. param2: Description of param2. Raises: OSError: When this exception is raised. RuntimeError: When this exception is raised. Returns: Description of the return value. ...will be parsed as \"parameters\", \"exceptions\" and \"return\" sections. Important Note the absence of type hints in the arguments and returns section: in mkdocstrings , the types are obtained using type annotations (using the typing module and builtin types), and not from type hints. It means that you must use type annotations in the signature of your function/method, or add a type annotation to an attribute. For example: def my_function ( param1 : int , param2 : Optional [ str ] = None ) -> typing .
